# Hashnat
hash to raw string converter 

This python code converts hash to raw string by comparing the hashed raw strings found in the wordlist you downloaded to the hash provided.
It supports 6 types of hashes:
1. LM
2. NTLM
3. MD5
4. SHA-1
5. SHA-256
6. SHA-512

In order to make this work follow the following steps:
- Download a word list in a text format or change it to text format after you download it
- Rename it to rockyou.txt because the code was based on a wordlist named rockyou
- Create a virtual environment
- Install required libraries
- Run hash.py
